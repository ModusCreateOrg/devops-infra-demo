Instructions
------------

 To run the demo end to end, you will need:

* [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/)
* [Google Cloud Account](https://cloud.google.com/)
* [Docker](https://docker.com/) (tested with 18.05.0-ce)
* [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) (tested with 1.0.3)
* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) (tested with  v0.11.7)
* [JQ](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) (tested with 1.3 and 1.5)

Optionally, you can use Vagrant to test ansible playbooks locally and Jenkins to orchestrate creation of AMIs in conjunction with GitHub branches and pull requests.

You will also need to set a few environment variables. The method of doing so will vary from platform to platform.

```
AWS_PROFILE
AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
GOOGLE_CLOUD_KEYFILE_JSON
GOOGLE_PROJECT
GOOGLE_REGION
PACKER_AWS_VPC_ID
PACKER_AWS_SUBNET_ID
```

A [sample file](env.sh.sample) is provided as a template to customize:

```
cp env.sh.sample env.sh
vim env.sh
. env.sh
```

The AWS profile IAM user should have full control of EC2 in the account you are using.

You will need to create an application in the Google developer console, create a set of service-to-service JSON credentials, and enable the Google Cloud Storage API in the referenced Google developer application for the Google integration to work. If you don't care about that, alternately you may remove the `terraform/google.tf` file to get the demo to work without the Google part.

### Packer

Run `packer/bin/pack.sh` to initiate a Packer run. This will provision a machine on EC2, configure it using Ansible, and scan it using [OpenSCAP](https://www.open-scap.org/) and [Gauntlt](http://gauntlt.org/). The results from the scan will end up in `packer/build`.

Optionally, you can use Vagrant to test ansible playbooks locally and Jenkins to orchestrate creation of AMIs in conjunction with GitHub branches and pull requests.

### Vagrant

In order to make developing the Ansible playbooks faster, a Vagrantfile is provided to provision a VM locally.

Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/). Change directory into the root of the repository at the command line and issue the command `vagrant up`. You can add or edit Ansible playbooks and support scripts then re-run the provisioning with `vagrant provision` to refine the remediations. This is more efficient that re-running packer and baking new AMIs for every change.

### Terraform

This Terraform setup stores its state in Amazon S3 and uses DynamoDB for locking. There is a bit of setup required to bootstrap the configuration. Check out `./terraform/bootstrap/README.md` to setup the resources required for backend.

If you override the default input values (by CLI or using a `.tfvars` file) for bootstrapping, please update the `terraform.backend` section in `./terraform/terraform.tf` to reflect that.

You'll also need to modify the list of operators who can modify the object in the S3 bucket. Put in the IAM user names of the user into the `setup/variables.tf` file in that project. If your Jenkins instance uses an IAM role to grant access, give it a similar set of permissions to those granted on in the bucket policy to IAM users.

These commands will then set up cloud resources using terraform:

    cd terraform
    terraform init
    terraform get
    # Example with values from our environment (replace with values from your environment)
    # terraform plan -var domain=modus.app -out tf.plan
    terraform plan -out tf.plan -var 'domain=example.net'
    terraform apply tf.plan
    # check to see if everything worked - use the same variables here as above
    terraform destroy -var 'domain=example.net'

Alternatively, use the wrapper script in `bin/terraform.sh` which will work interactively or from CI:

   bin/terraform.sh plan
   bin/terraform.sh apply
   bin/terraform.sh plan-destroy
   bin/terraform.sh destroy

This assumes that you already have a Route 53 domain in your AWS account created.
You need to either edit variables.tf to match your domain and AWS zone or specify these values as command line `var` parameters.

The application loads an image from Google storage. To get it loading correctly, edit the `application/assets/css/main.css` file and replace `example-media-website-storage.storage.googleapis.com` with a DNS reference for your Google storage location.

### Auto Scaling Groups

The application in this demo uses an AWS Auto Scaling Group in order to dynamically change the number of servers deployed in response to load. Two policies help guide how many instances are available: a CPU scaling policy that seeks to keep the average CPU load below 40% in the cluster, and a scheduled scaling policy that scales the entire cluster down to 0 instances at 02:00 UTC every night, to minimize the charges should you forget to destroy the cluster. If the cluster is scaled down to 0 instances, you will need to edit the Auto Scaling Group through the console, the CLI, or an API call to set the sizes to non-zero, for example

### Elastic Load Balancing

This demo allocates a single Classic ELB in order to load balance HTTP traffic among the running instances. This load balancer integrates with the auto scaling group and instances will join and leave the ELB automatically when created or destroyed.

### CodeDeploy

The application enclosed in this demo is packaged and deployed using [AWS CodeDeploy](https://aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/). The script `codedeploy/bin/build.sh` will package the application so that it can be deployed on the AMI built with Ansible and Packer.

The application contains both a simple HTML web site, and a Python app that has an API endpoint of `/api/spin` that spins the CPU of the server, in order to more easily test CPU-sensing auto scaling scale-out operations.

You must deploy the application at least once in order to begin testing the web server and spin service, as it starts the web server as part of its deployment process. New instances scaled out should automatically have a deployment triggered on them through an Auto Scaling Group hook.

There's an explicit dependency between the CodeDeploy application and the auto scaling group because the hook will not get created if the CodeDeploy application is created before the Auto Scaling Group.

### JMeter

A JMeter test harness allows testing of the application at scale. This uses a Docker container to run JMeter, and has a Jenkins test harness to allow you to run JMeter through Jenkins and record its outputs. See [`bin/jmeter.sh`](bin/jmeter.sh) and the JMeter test file [`jmeter/api-spin.jmx`](jmeter/api-spin.jmx).

### Jenkins

A `Jenkinsfile` is provided that will allow Jenkins to execute Packer and Terraform, package a CodeDeploy application, and even run JMeter performance tests. In order for Jenkins to do this, it needs to have AWS credentials set up, preferably through an IAM role, granting full control of EC2 and VPC resources in that account, and write access to the S3 bucket used for storing CodeDeploy applications. Packer needs this in order to create AMIs, key pairs, etc, Terraform needs this to create a VPC and EC2 resources, and CodeDeploy needs this to store the artifact it creates. This could be pared down further through some careful logging and role work.

The Jenkins executor running this job needs to have both a recent Docker and the jq utility (version 1.3 or higher) installed.

The scripts here assume that Jenkins is running on EC2 and uses instance data from the Jenkins executor to infer what VPC and subnet to launch the new EC2 instance into.  The AWS profile IAM user associated with your Jenkins instance or the Jenkins user's AWS credentials should have full control of EC2 in the account you are using.

This script relies on Jenkins having a secret file containing the Google application credentials in JSON with the id `terraform-demo.json`. You will need to add that to your Jenkins server's credentials.

After a sucessful build, Jenkins will archive the artifacts from the OpenSCAP and Gauntlt scans (if a Packer run has completed) and JMeter (if a JMeter run has completed).
